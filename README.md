# YouTube Caption Transcript Generator

This is a tiny Java program that converts YouTube caption JSONs into readable transcripts. Very useful if you want to get a somewhat accurate transcript of a speech but don't want to pay for transcription services.

- Using GSON to parse JSON
- Whipped up in 10 minutes, excuse any bugs
- Import or open directly in IntelliJ - I didn't bother properly exporting but all the files are here
